Build a clean, intuitive web application for a civic assistant called “Nagrik Seva”.

The goal is to create a working prototype that feels more helpful and transparent than existing civic complaint apps, by focusing on clarity, guidance, visibility, and tracking, not just ticket creation.

🔹 CORE PRINCIPLES (IMPORTANT)

This is NOT just a complaint form

This app must explain issues, show impact, and keep them visible

Use simple logic, mock data, and simulated AI

The app should be understandable in under 2 minutes

🔹 TECH REQUIREMENTS

Use HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript

Mobile-first, responsive design

Soft civic color palette (blue, green, white)

No login/authentication

No backend APIs (use browser memory / localStorage)

Clearly comment code

🔹 MAIN SCREENS & FEATURES
1️⃣ HOME / CHAT INTERFACE (PRIMARY ENTRY)

Chat-style interface similar to ChatGPT

Header:

App Name: Nagrik Seva

Tagline: “Your everyday civic help partner”

Chat bubbles:

User messages on right

Assistant messages on left

Input field:

Placeholder: “Describe your civic issue…”

Send button

Microphone icon (UI only)

2️⃣ REAL-TIME AI ISSUE UNDERSTANDING (SIMULATED)

When the user submits text like:

“Garbage hasn’t been picked up near my house for 3 days”

The system should:

Detect issue category using keyword rules:

Waste, Water, Air, Transport, Energy

Detect mock location & language

Assistant response must:

Clearly acknowledge the issue

Explain why it matters

Example:

“This looks like a waste management issue.
Garbage accumulation can spread disease.”

3️⃣ ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE PANEL (KEY DIFFERENTIATOR)

Display a clear guidance card, NOT just a button.

Card sections:

Why this matters

Short explanation of risk

What you can do
✔ Avoid the area if possible
✔ Upload a photo (optional)
✔ Report to the local sanitation department

Who handles this

🏢 Responsible department

📞 Helpline number

📍 Nearest office

Button: Submit Report

4️⃣ REPORT SUBMISSION FLOW

On clicking Submit Report:

Open a modal or new screen with:

Photo upload (mock)

Short note field

Submit button

After submission:

Show confirmation message

Generate mock Issue ID

Display text:

“Report forwarded to local authority via email.”

Button: Track Issue

5️⃣ ISSUE TRACKING DASHBOARD (NOT JUST A TICKET)

Screen title: My Issues

Each issue card must show:

Issue type

Area

Days unresolved

Number of people affected

Visual status timeline:

🟡 Reported

🔵 Forwarded

🟠 In Progress

🟢 Resolved

Add button:

“Simulate Status Update”

6️⃣ PUBLIC VISIBILITY DASHBOARD (USP – WHAT COMPETITORS DON’T HAVE)

Screen title: Area Issues Overview

Show:

Grouped issues by area

Labels such as:

“12 people affected”

“Unresolved for 5 days”

Add a simple heatmap simulation:

Use colored blocks/circles:

🔴 High unresolved issues

🟡 Medium

🟢 Low

Display message:

“Issues remain visible until resolved.”

7️⃣ SMART FOLLOW-UP & REMINDERS

Add simulation controls:

Button: “Simulate 3 days passed”

On click:

Show reminder notification:

“This issue is still unresolved. You may follow up.”

🔹 FUNCTIONAL LOGIC

Use JavaScript to:

Classify issues using keywords

Store issues in arrays or localStorage

Group issues by area & type

Track time unresolved

Update UI dynamically

🔹 WHY THIS APP IS BETTER THAN COMPETITORS (MUST REFLECT IN UI)

Shows context before action

Explains why the issue matters

Makes problems visible to everyone

Does not silently close issues

Remains useful even if authorities don’t respond

🔹 FINAL REQUIREMENT

The prototype must clearly demonstrate that Nagrik Seva focuses on visibility and understanding, not just complaint submission.

A judge should immediately see:

Clear guidance

Honest tracking

Public accountability

Real-world feasibility

End the app with this line displayed somewhere clearly:
“We don’t promise faster fixes. We promise that problems won’t be silently ignored.”
